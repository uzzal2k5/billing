# each project can have different discount during differnt billing periods
# discounts are always offered as a percentage of the total bill amount
# discounts are stored as a dictionary with project-id (matches with Collab project-id) as identifier for each project
# the amount in front of discount field in this config file indicates the percentage discount e.g. 0.9 means 90% discount
# each project can have a list of discounts applicable to different billing periods
# no start and end date means that discount will always be applied
# period_start means that discounts starts at the 1st of that month;
# period_end means that discount ends at last day of that month
# Assumptions:
# 0. Discount amount is always a number between 0 - 1
# 1. For each invoice period; there should be max one entry per project
# 2. We don't foresee any need of itemized discounts in the future
# 3. For the sake of simplicity; We are not keeping any global discounts section.
#    If; there is ever a need of a global discount;
#    individual project's discounts will be updated (potentially using a script)
# 4. Discounts are only applicable to Invoice; the billing application UI will never have to show it
# 5. Invoice periods and discount periods will always align
